#  Restaurant Project

So far I 'm uploading the project at the final of part Four. 
In the next Days I'll update it for getting the rest of the parts done.

Happy week, happy coding ! =)


## So I made some mods on the weekend
 
 
 - Finished the example and start moding it. 
started to look around what were the workarounds and the good parts of the code...

I have to finish this TODAY !! ðŸ˜– (Finished at 16 of september but finished !!)

## So for getting the local server up and running

Since the App that came on the Resources folder didn't work, someone on reddit posted the solution in a python file. 
For running it, you just open a terminal and type the next command: 
'''
python OpenRestaurant.py

'''



## To Do's
- Part Six  (Done)
- Part Seven  (Done)
- Part Eight (Done)
